To simulations with many VMs is necessary to allocate more 
virtual memory to Lingo. So, in Lingo shell (to reserve at least 1Gb):
: SET MXMEMB 1000000
: FREEZE
: QUIT

CPU
: SET LCORES 4
: FREEZE

To limit Lingo iteractions:
: SET ITRLIM 150000
: FREEZE

To recover a range (sensibility analysis):
: SET DUALCO 2
: FREEZE

Help:
: HELP SET

More commands are listed in Lingo manual.

Not hesitate in contact me for any help about MILPFlow usage :-)
